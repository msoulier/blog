So previously I was using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) which is still a solid option for me, but since Hugo is so popular I thought that I would take a look at it. That, and a workflow publish from [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/), which is now available with support in Emacs, NeoVim, and even some in VSCode.

Happy with what I see so far. Stay tuned.
