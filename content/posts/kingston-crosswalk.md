In the summer of 2022 I took my lovely wife Maria to the exotic town of Kingston, Ontario for a weekend. The weather was beautiful, the AirBnB we stayed in was very nice, and overall we had a nice weekend, beyond my terrible overall lack of planning.

_You have to plan more than just the destination and accomodations, Michael._

Still, Kingston had an oddity that did stand out, when we walked down towards the water.

Umm, full stop. Absolutely every single person that I have shown this to says the same thing.

Yep. That was my first thought too. So, to the Kingston city council, I must ask...what exactly were you thinking here?
