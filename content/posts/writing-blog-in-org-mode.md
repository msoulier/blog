So, as I haven't used that **other** editor in many, many years, with all of the hype around [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/), [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs), etc., I thought that I would take another look. Granted, Vim has been forked as NeoVim, with fun packages to compete like NVChad, but there has always been something about Emacs that intriged me, and horrified me at the same time.

The joke was always that Emacs was a wonderful operating system, it just needed a decent editor. Well, if that is a reference to Vi keybindings then evil-mode works pretty damn well, at least as good as the vim extension for VSCode.
