I don't get Marketing, I really don't. Someone actually got paid to do this, and the company must have paid a lot of money to rebrand like this, but can you imagine the meeting when this was pitched to the suits in some office?

I mean, how did they even say it? Try it, right now, just to yourself.

They're likely paid better than me, but I just don't get it.

Then again, the branding of many companies is a little odd, including the one that I work for, so I'll shut up now.
