      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I am a professional software developer, who has been in the industry of
software development for over twenty years, starting with
<a href="http://www.nortel.com">Nortel</a> as my first job out of University, and
eventually moving to <a href="http://www.mitel.com">Mitel</a>, working on
developing and porting VoIP applications on the Linux platform. I
specialize in Unix systems programming and Web applications, primarily,
but I have dabbled in many things and I learn quickly.</p>
<p>I believe in developing applications in such a manner that the company
that I work for maintains their right to choice of tools and platforms
in the future. My choice of tools such as Perl, Python, Ruby and Go
demonstrate that portability and lack of &ldquo;lock-in&rdquo;, although I have
happily developed in C/C++ and maintained the same values.</p>
<p>I believe in doing the job right, and standing up for quality,
constantly learning to discover new ways to develop software in the most
cost-effective manner possible, while not sacrificing that quality. I
have seen many examples of software done, &ldquo;the wrong way&rdquo;, with the
wrong tools and the wrong values. I draw on those examples of what not
to do on every new project.</p>
<h2 id="qualifications-summary">Qualifications Summary</h2>
<p>My qualifications for the job are as follows. For full details on the
material in this summary, please refer to the section entitled
Experience, and the sections that follow it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Twenty-two year&rsquo;s experience with <a href="http://www.mitel.com">Mitel</a> as a
software engineer, working on the Mitel 6000 Managed Application
Server (formerly the E-Smith server and gateway), as well as
applications on top of that server such as the Teleworker Solution
(now MiVoice Border Gateway), Secure Recording Connector, Office
Productivity blade, and the IPSec VPN blade. I worked on other add-on
blades as well, such as Mobile Extension, Groupware, Instant
Messaging, Web Access Control, and others. I have spent much of my
time as an internal Linux and technology consultant, helping to port
VoIP applications to Linux from Windows and VxWorks, and giving an
occasional internal tutorial. Most work was done in Perl, C/C++,
Python, Javascript, Go and a little Java. A few years back I spearheaded
breaking up MBG into micro-services to run in Kubernetes, and wrote MSL&rsquo;s
ReST interface for remote management.</li>
<li>Four years experience with <a href="http://www.nortel.com">Nortel</a>,
designing software development tools for internal use, both web-based
and other, as well as assisting in development of product code. Three
internal courses designed and taught to employees during that time as
well. Most work was done in Perl, but also included C, C++, Java,
Python, PHP and Tcl. Projects included web-design, database
integration, Unix Systems programming, automation and Systems
Administration.</li>
<li>President and co-founder of the Nortel Linux User&rsquo;s Group, from its
creation until I left Nortel.</li>
<li>Vice President of the Board for the Ottawa Canada Linux User&rsquo;s Group,
2003-2004.</li>

<li>B.Ed. Education, University of Windsor</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<h3 id="mitel">Mitel</h3>
<p>Since September of 2002, I have been employed by
<a href="http://www.mitel.com">Mitel</a>, starting in the Network Server
Solutions Group. This group was formerly a separate company known as
E-Smith, acquired by Mitel. I was then moved into the Common Platforms
group, and from there to Applications, as they desired my expertise on
Linux to port their existing apps.</p>
<p>My responsibilities at Mitel have been as a full-time developer on the
SME Server software, performing bug fixes, implementing new features,
and performing verification of the various aspects of the server. A wide
range of skills have been required to accomplish this, due to the nature
of the server, the number of environments it must work within, and the
number of internet protocols involved.</p>
<p>As of the layoffs at Mitel late in 2003, I became one of two individuals
remaining working on the Mitel 6000 MAS, and it&rsquo;s associated
applications. As such, I shared responsibility for all aspects of the
product&rsquo;s development, from project management to bug tracking, to
release and stream management.</p>
<p>I have also been one of the two prime developers on the Mitel Teleworker
Solution, enabling teleworkers to connect to their corporate phone
network securly via the internet, and a Mitel Networks IP phone, and am
currently the project&rsquo;s development prime.</p>
<p>In 2004 I was made feature prime for a new Traffic Shaping feature on
the SX-200 ICP, to enable prioritization of VoIP trunks between remote
networks connected via IPSec VPN. I was responsible for all aspects of
this feature&rsquo;s design and development. My System Behavioural
Specification is still the definitive internal reference on the subject.</p>
<p>That year on Teleworker I also implemented a plug-in framework to
<a href="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/">net-snmp</a>, implementing support for
Mitel&rsquo;s proprietary MiB definitions, and leaving full documentation for
our other applications to follow. Two additional applications have added
SNMP support since, with less than a day&rsquo;s work required. Coupled with
this system was an entire event subsystem, including an events database,
SNMP trap support, and a full web interface to the database to view
events and clear alarms.</p>
<p>In 2005 I was made the development prime for the Teleworker Solution,
and promoted to Engineering Level III. I was also made the integration
prime for Mobile Extension, Release 1.0, coordinating ClearCase
submissions into coherent builds and packaging the results for Linux
deployment. In addition, on that application itself I did a great deal
of Java development, including a brand new JNI/C API for interfacing to
a legacy database. I also maintained the Ant-based build system, and
implemented precompilation of all JSP pages in the Web UI, while
assisting with the maintenance of the JSP pages and front-end
Javascript.</p>
<p>In 2006 I completed a Teleworker release that added Client-side x509
Certificate support to the server, and upgraded the PKI on the server to
a full Certificate Authority, tied-in with Mitel&rsquo;s root Certificate.
This feature taught me a great deal about PKIs, SSL and OpenSSL&rsquo;s
implementation. We added a REST-like web services interface that is now
used by multiple third-parties to completely automate client-side
certificate requests and importing from their products.</p>
<p>Also in 2006, I moved back from the Applications group to Applications
Infrastructure, working again on the evolution of Mitel&rsquo;s Linux
platform, while providing design, direction and APIs for applications to
align with. At this time I also began prototyping a new application, the
Secure Recording Connector, with the web user-interface done using
<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. I chose Rails as a
candidate for our web interfaces going forwards, after assessing several
solutions in Perl, Python and Java. To help introduce the technology and
share my experience, I gave an internal tutorial on Ruby on Rails that
year. I then expanded on that talk and gave it at ExitCertified as an
OCLUG tutorial. For time-to-market reasons, our legacy web framework was
used for this in the end, but the evaluation helped me finally choose
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> as the next-generation web
framework for the server.</p>
<p>In 2007, I completed work on releases of Teleworker Solution and Secure
Recording Connector. New innovations included a self-diagnostic
framework in SRC, as well as a desktop graphical reference
implementation of a call recording application to integrate with SRC.
This desktop application, of which I did the graphical interface, was
built on portable libraries and used <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">Gtk+</a> for
the graphical API, which permitted the same code to build for both Linux
and Windows desktops.</p>
<p>In 2008 I completely redesigned the Teleworker management layer for a
rebranded solution, the Multi-Protocol Border Gateway, using mostly
Python and Django. This release removed the roadblocks to scalability
that were in place from the original design, and permitted a complete
merging of the SRC and MBG code bases in the next releases, to reduce
maintenance and improve time to market for both products. As part of
this redesign, I implemented a framework for Mitel Standard Linux using
Django that is now in common use by application developers for that
platform.</p>
<p>In 2009 the Multi-protocol Border Gateway was rebranded to the Mitel
Border Gateway, and we released the 5.1 and 5.2 releases of the product.
As the underlying software was virtually identical to the Secure Call
Recorder, we unified the management layer of the two into a single code
base with two deliverables, with hooks for rebranding. We also added
suport for SIP trunking and furthered the support for SIP devices. In
the meantime, to satisfy a need to permit remote users&rsquo; access to
selected LAN applications securely, I designed and implemented the Web
Proxy, release 1.0 and 2.0.</p>
<p>In 2010 we consolidated SRC into MBG and released the 6.0 and 6.1
releases of the product, further improving SIP trunking support and
continuing to evolve the management interface after the merging of the
call recording solution. Web Proxy 2.0 was untouched, as there were no
field found problems.</p>
<p>In 2011 MBG was enhanced and released as version 7.0, further improving
all SIP support, continuing to evolve the management interface and
delving into the world of IPv6. MBG has experimental IPv6 support at
this time, as worldwide IPv6 adoption is slow. Later in 2011 in 7.1 the
bulk of the 7.1 release was finished, enhancing troubleshooting and
maintenance or the release, and adding the remote management proxy to
the application to permit web-based remote management of Mitel
applications. One of the features included in the 7.1 release was a
web-based tcpdump and traceroute that I designed and implemented.</p>
<p>In 2012 we continued supporting the 7.1 release, enhancing scaling of
SIP trunk deployments for hosted environments, greatly enhanced security
in a special 7.2 release, while continuing in the development release of
8.0. The 8.0 release further enhanced SIP interoperability, security,
maintenance and monitoring, and remote management capabilities with
Mitel&rsquo;s flagship IP PBX, the Mitel Communications Director.</p>
<p>Development of 8.0 continued in 2013, with inclusion of the ability to
upload large MCD images to MBG, to allow remote upgrades of MCD and
prevent truck-rolls. In parallel, I implemented a REST Web service for
Mitel Standard Linux with plugins for applications, implemented in Perl
and Mojolicious. The existing OAuth libraries were insufficient for my
purposes, so I wrote my own. Meanwhile, I began playing with the
Raspberry Pi, and with the help of a long-time coworker, ported MBG to
the Raspberry Pi as an experiment. To achieve this, I redesigned the
entire management layer to work on this platform, and wrote a new
interface using AngularJS, an impressive new single-page application
framework from Google that I&rsquo;ve come to like. Since then we have
supported the Raspberry Pi 3, with a new UI in Vue.js, and a management
layer in Python and Go (more on that later).</p>
<p>Work completed in 2013 while maintaining 5 parallel streams, 7.1, 7.2,
8.0, 8.1 and 9.0. Quite challenging for a small development team, but
we&rsquo;ve found that using the appropriate tools goes a very long way, and
Git is the appropriate tool here.</p>
<p>In 2014 my team finished up the 8.0 release, and used 8.1 to port it to
an updated base MSL operating system. 8.1 also saw the addition of a
custom ReST service that I wrote for MSL, written in Perl and using the
Mojolicious web framework, with a custom OAuth 1.0a implementation that
I wrote myself, as the Net::OAuth module did not seem to be implemented
properly. I wrote the ReST framework with plugins in mind, and after
MSL&rsquo;s plugin, MBG&rsquo;s was next, making use of a back-end Tornodo process
to centralize validation in the Django forms and models.</p>
<p>In 2015 we made major user interface changes in MBG in the 9.0 release,
fixing performance issues in our event processing by going to an
on-demand polling model for system status. Meanwhile the 8.1 version of
the ReST framework had to be maintained permanently as version 1 of the
API, so I added a new serialization framework that included versioned
adapters, so we could continue to make schema changes but present the
same ReST API. We also added full Unicode support in the management
layer, working around the inability of our core service to understand
it. Additional threads were added to the management layer&rsquo;s event daemon
to improve performance, and I began experimenting with C++ and Google Go
versions of this daemon, as Python&rsquo;s performance limitations began to
show, including issues with the Global Interpreter Lock in a
multi-threaded, multi-core environment.</p>
<p>The 9.1 release continued this theme, and included an overhaul of our
metrics graphing subsystem, moving to use jquery-jqplot to make the
graphs more live and interactive. This did involve solving some
performance problems with large amounts of data, including aggresive
caching. 2015 closed out with our start on the MBG 9.2 release, which
mostly involved alignment with Mitel&rsquo;s latest mergers and acquisitions,
but for myself included integration of a new webrtc component, to permit
anonymous and subscriber calls to our call managers from a simple web
browser.</p>
<p>2015 involved the 9.2 and 9.3 releases, incorporating WebRTC
functionality in MBG, and support for new call managers from Aastra. In
2016 we completed the 9.4 release with tone injection support, and
scaling changes to support 50000 DID rules on a SIP trunk, both in the
management UI and ReST interfaces. The 10.0 release primary included
configuration enhancements for ease of use, and a plugin framework for
adaptation of SIP headers in internal pipelines using the Lua scripting
language.</p>
<p>2016 covered the 11.0 release, and experimentation into packaging our
software in Docker containers for deployment into the cloud. I headed
this re-architecture into microservices, and to this day MBG is the only
application within Mitel to truly leverage a microservice architecture.</p>
<p>As of all of this work I am now one of the local GCP and Kubernetes
experts within Mitel, for better or for worse. Kubernetes was not a good fit
for our solutions, and we warned management about that. Said solution no longer
exists.</p>
<p>Over the last few years we have pulled MBG out of K8s, implemented our own
WebRTC implementation and greatly enhanced our security profile in a variety
of ways. We are currently integrating with Zoom for SIP trunking, and I re-wrote
most of our UI to use VueJS 3.0 in the course of one release. Keeping all
open-source subsystems updated to avoid security issues is an ongoing
challenge.</p>
<p>On the side, I set up and still maintain an internal R&amp;D Wiki and
Mailing list server, now used by the bulk of the R&amp;D organization. I
have given several internal courses on a variety of subjects, from
packaging software using RPM, to perl programming, to introductions to
Unix, Ruby on Rails, Django and Git.</p>
<p>We have continued our work on the Raspberry Pi, porting to the RP 3,
using a web server written in Google Go. My coworker wrote a C++ API for
managing our data transparently in a cluster, which I wrote Go and
Python extensions for to use from my code. It is currently an ongoing
prototyping environment that we use to determine where we want to
product to eventually go, architecturally speaking.</p>
<p>To keep my work flexible I used to mirror all my work into my private
Git repositories, pushing them into the corporate-provided ClearCase
repositories when appropriate. This kept my full project history
available at all times, with or without network connectivity. I
advocated this workflow to others internally and externally, and used it
on my open-source projects.</p>
<p>Since then I was tasked with building our nightly build system to move
us completely out of ClearCase and into a pure Git environment. I built
it in Python, and it runs every night on every supported release,
automatically picking up changes from developers and building if there
are changes to build. It builds the blade, pushing it to our AMC for
deployment, and then builds a VMWare .ova file for deploying in the
VSphere environment. It then messages our auto-sanity group through an
ActiveMQ server to launch their automated sanity suite. I also built our
nightly build website using Flask, which displays build status, sanity
status, and allows export of the entire load.</p>
<h3 id="nortel">Nortel</h3>
<p>From 1998 - 2002, I was employed in the 10Gig Optical Division of
<a href="http://www.nortel.com">Nortel</a> in the Global Backbone Transport
Development&rsquo;s Operations, Development and Support department. I resigned
in 2002 to join Mitel.</p>
<p>At Nortel, I have maintained a great deal of software ranging from Unix
shell scripts, to CGI scripts in Perl, to full applications written in
Perl. I rewrote two aging Perl applications to bring them up to date.</p>
<p>The first major redesign was known as &ldquo;Prepare&rdquo;, a Perl application
responsible for performing all of the build testing on the code that a
designer was about to submit to a build, and then packaging and
documenting their changes automatically. For this project I was required
to go through the entire documentation process of requirements,
high-level design and estimates, functional description, design
description and test plan. Prepare was last approaching a 2.2 release,
with no major outstanding bugs.</p>
<p>The second major redesign I performed was to a tool called &ldquo;Scaload&rdquo;,
which was responsible for packaging the finished products after a build,
and generating the software catalogs used to define a release and permit
in-service upgrades, as well as basic commissioning of a network
element. For this redesign I eliminated the need for complex, in-house
parsing code of configuration files by inventing a language in XML, and
using an XML parser. I also combined the many branches of the original
code into one branch, preventing the need for code propagation in
features and bug fixes, while maintaining branch-specific configuration
files for every 10Gig release, to allow each release to customize their
catalogs. I found XML a fascinating technology, using it to generate
many of my documents as well as being used as the foundational
technology for configuration of my last project, a tool-independent
software release management system.</p>
<p>After identifying major problems with the organization of the
mission-critical web-site that my department controls, I completely
redesigned it, replacing it with an organized, consistent site where
information is easy to find. Our problem tracking tool additionally did
not scale to our uses, being written by a high-school student with a
back-end of text files and shell scripts. I redesigned it, and replaced
it with a PHP-driven site with a back-end in MySQL, with unlimited
possibilities for new features in the future.</p>
<p>On a regular basis, I assisted in development of production code within
Nortel for our 10Gig Optera DX product line. In this effort, I assisted
with high-level packaging, and occasionally low-level coding issues when
the developers found themselves at a roadblock that they could not
overcome.</p>
<p>I have also overseen the evolution of some of the tools used in my
department, primarily spear-heading the implementation of the latest
build of Perl and the evaluation of a new, 3rd party editor, Visual
SlickEdit. I also looked after many builds of free software for the
design community, building tools like Emacs, Vim, Python, LaTeX, gcc,
etc., on HP-UX 9.05 and 10.20 for our use.</p>
<p>I was one of the few people at Nortel using Linux on my desktop machine.
With the permission of my immediate supervisor, I installed over the
Windows NT machine I was given, and spearheaded an effort to put Linux
on the desktop for those at Nortel who felt they had a true business
need for it. I was in &ldquo;negotiations&rdquo; with our IS groups at Nortel for
some time, and was a major stakeholder in Linux on the desktop at
Nortel, as well as an advocate for open standards in the workplace.</p>
<p>In addition to my computer science experience, Nortel allowed me to add
to my teaching experience gained from the University of Windsor&rsquo;s
teacher&rsquo;s college by teaching several courses at Nortel. I regularly
taught courses in Software Packaging and testing, use of our proprietary
configuration management and build system, and use of the &ldquo;Prepare&rdquo;
testing tool that I designed and wrote. Additionally, I identified a
serious lack of knowledge among our design community with basic use of
the Unix operating system, so I designed and taught an introductory
course in Unix aimed at practical use with solutions to common problems.</p>
<h2 id="other-relevant-skills">Other Relevant Skills</h2>
<p>I have a great deal of experience in team environments, and completing a
long-term task by a given deadline.</p>
<p>At McMaster University, I completed both a B.Sc. in Physics, and a B.Sc.
with Honours in Computer Science. Between the two, I have had a great
deal of experience with technology in a research and development
environment. The Physics degree augmented my Computer Science knowledge
with a strong foundation in electromagnetic and electronic theory,
providing me with a much broader base to understand digital electronics
than my peers in the Computer Science program. The Computer Science
program at McMaster ensured that I have a proper theoretical foundation
for software design and development. My Computer Science thesis project
was a 3D simulation application using OpenGL and VC++ on Windows NT. We
placed in the top three projects of the year.</p>
<p>At the University of Windsor, I learned skills invaluable every time I
am called upon to do a presentation, or teach a course internally. I can
now apply modern educational theory to my courses, and easily assess the
experience level of my audience, adjusting my presentation accordingly
during the presentation.</p>
<h2 id="extracurricular-activities">Extracurricular Activities</h2>
<p>Outside of my daily work at Nortel, I have not sat still for very long.</p>
<h3 id="opag-the-ottawa-python-author-s-group">OPAG - The Ottawa Python Author&rsquo;s Group</h3>
<p>I am co-founder of the Ottawa Python Author&rsquo;s Group, or
<a href="http://www.opag.ca">OPAG</a>. This is a group of Python enthusiasts in
the Ottawa, Canada area who are attempting to improve their programming
abilities, provide a resource to Python developers everywhere, and
increase awareness of the Python programming language.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I taught an introductory course on Python for
<a href="http://www.exitcertified.com/">ExitCertified</a>, an IT training firm
here in Ottawa.</p>
<p>I also authored the OPAG website, and am hosting it free of charge for
OPAG. I had come up with a maintenance scheme to permit other OPAG
developers to collaborate via CVS repository, and then Subversion,
pushing the site to production via a combination of Bourne Shell, Python
and rsync. That is no longer required, as the site is maintained in Git
on github now, so I simply service pull requests from other members and
serve as integration prime.</p>
<h3 id="nlug-the-nortel-linux-user-s-group">NLUG - The Nortel Linux User&rsquo;s Group</h3>
<p>I was co-founder of the Nortel Linux User&rsquo;s Group, and I was the NLUG
President from it&rsquo;s inception to late 2002 when I left Nortel. Founded
in 1999 in Ottawa, NLUG is a group of Linux enthusiasts working for
Nortel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nortel Linux User&rsquo;s Group Ottawa (nlug-ottawa) is a group
dedicated to bringing, through Linux, open standard solutions to
Nortel Networks employees. These solutions may appear either in a
product, as support, data format or on the desktop. We are a group
dedicated to software that is reliable, and that does not eliminate
your right to choice. We stand for using the right tool every time.</p>
<p>-NLUG Mandate</p></blockquote>
<p>The Nortel Linux User&rsquo;s Group has, I&rsquo;m told, somewhat stagnated since I
left Nortel. It would seem that no one has taken the time to push its
development, not surprising since most likely everyone at Nortel is
working very hard. I am told that I am still listed as President on the
website.</p>
<h3 id="oclug-the-ottawa-canada-linux-user-s-group">OCLUG - The Ottawa Canada Linux User&rsquo;s Group</h3>
<p>I have been a member of OCLUG since 1998, when I first became involved
in using Linux for my home computing needs. Over that time, I have
become involved in OCLUG events, given talks at OCLUG meetings, tutored
classes at ExitCertified via OCLUG, and served as board Vice President
from 2003-2004. Please see the OCLUG Homepage for more information,
which I was the webmaster for from roughly 2004 - 2006. This is the
<a href="http://tux.oclug.on.ca/pipermail/oclug-announce/2006-September/000184.html">official
thanks</a> from the board for my work during that time.</p>
<h3 id="home-networking">Home Networking</h3>
<p>At home, I have set up and currently maintain a home network of Linux
and Windows machines, using one box as a NAT server to permit all
machines on the network to share a 1 Meg DSL connection. The NAT server
also acted as a web server, name server, mail server and a code
repository, as well as running a firewall for security purposes. I used
to run two PPPoE connections from the NAT server, using one to connect
to Nortel&rsquo;s corporate intranet to permit me to work remotely, but
obviously not since I left Nortel.</p>
<p>I reconfigured my network by replacing my generic Linux NAT box by a
Mitel 6000 MAS running on a home PC, such that I might use our own
products and ensure that I see problems sooner than our customers do. I
virtually hosted three websites on that server, including my blog, a
photo gallery, and other third party additions to my site. Since then I
have moved these apps off to other online services, as well as a VPS
that I pay for through Webfaction.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have added a wireless broadband router to my home
network, adding 802.11g support. As the &ldquo;routers&rdquo; are actually cheaper
than an access point, I added it into my network by having the WAN port
receive DHCP from my gateway, hanging all wireless clients off of an
additional network. While this causes everything outbound to undergo NAT
twice, it offers an extra level of security as well, and it is
functioning perfectly.</p>
<p>After a major hardware failure, I reconfigured the network again, using
the LinkSys NAT box as my firewall, and placing FreeBSD on a home server
on my LAN, portforwarding HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP and SSH to that FreeBSD box.
While I am a big fan of Linux, experimenting with other technologies
from time to time is a good thing, and FreeBSD is very impressive.</p>
<p>To gain additional networking knowledge on FreeBSD, I then put the
FreeBSD box in as my firewall/gateway/NAT box. The PPPoE configuration
on FreeBSD is the simplest I&rsquo;ve seen on any platform, and it ended up
being a trivial change that offered far greater control over the LAN&rsquo;s
connection up to the Internet. I&rsquo;ve also installed the Hexago freenet6
client, and was experimenting running a dual ipv4/ipv6 stack.</p>
<p>Since then I moved all my boxes to Debian stable, beyond the occasional
Windows box, and maintain an IPv6 tunnel through Hurricane Electric. The
experimentation with other operating systems was educational, but
finally I went for ease of maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="active-activities">Active Activities</h2>
<p>I currently hold a red belt in Tae Kwon Do and I get regular workouts at
home and with a trainer, as well as attending Yoga classes. I enjoy
archery all year round, and during the summer I enjoy cycling and
hiking, two things that Ottawa is perfectly suited for. For winter
activities, I occasionally snowshoe and I love curling.</p>
