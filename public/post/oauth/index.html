			<p>We meet again. Thanks for stopping by. This post has a high geek factor,
so if you&rsquo;re not one, feel free to move along, nothing to see here.</p>
<p>Still here? K, your funeral. At work, I&rsquo;m trying to add a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">ReST</a> Web
Service to a product that could desperately use it. I want to do this to
permit better remote monitoring of said product and remote control for
one of our management services and future UIs that I may implement
(think apps on Android and iOS).</p>
<p>This is no small task, and it cannot be taken lightly. It will likely be
used by many, so it must be easy to debug and integrate with, hence
ReST. I&rsquo;ll rant about the evils of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> later. It must be secure,
which is easy, <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> is already on the
system, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">SSL</a>
support. It must be authenticated. This is tougher.</p>
<p>Since I expect SSL, I could require client certificates, but they&rsquo;re a
pain to provision. You don&rsquo;t authenticate to amazon.com with client
certificates for this reason. Setting them up is about as much fun as
visiting the passport office, and it hurts the wallet too. Why should
anyone pay for the privilege of shopping in a store? Oh&hellip;I&rsquo;ll rant
about <a href="http://www.costco.com/">CostCo</a> later.</p>
<p>A popular method of authentication for web services is now
<a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a>. OAuth was designed to fix a particular
problem. Example: I like <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I hate
Twitter&rsquo;s web interface. I prefer lightweight and simple. Plus, it&rsquo;s
terrible to use from a smartphone. Fortunately, Twitter has a ReST web
service that uses OAuth for authentication, so a vendor can release a
Twitter app for my phone that I can connect to my account. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; you
ask, &ldquo;surely you don&rsquo;t give this app your Twitter password!&rdquo; No. I
don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a closed-source app and for all I know, they&rsquo;d send it to
themselves for nefarious purposes. I want the app to access my Twitter
account, but I do <em>not</em> want them to have my password. How do we do
this? Enter OAuth.</p>
<p>How does it work? The idea is simple. I&rsquo;m going to go to my Twitter
account, and tell Twitter to issue a random &ldquo;token&rdquo; in my name. If you
think you don&rsquo;t know what a token is, think again. I suspect you carry
keys, id badges, smartcards, that kind of thing. There isn&rsquo;t any
practical difference, beyond keys being functional mechanically. This
token I will then <em>securely</em> provide to the Twitter client on my phone,
and when Twitter sees it, it will know that the client is mine, and
grant access. The token will be transmitted over SSL to avoid spying and
replay attacks, the hard part is securely getting the token into the
client, and keeping it convenient. We do <em>not</em> want a repeat of SSL
client certificates. Provisioning needs to be simple.</p>
<p>But, automating such things is problematic. Even if you implement a
request queue for token requests, you don&rsquo;t want it to fill up with
spammed garbage requests, and it will if we don&rsquo;t prevent it. Spammers
should be pulled into the street and shot, but I digress. A way to
prevent this is to at least have an existing relationship between the
app vendor and the service. So, if I want to distribute an app, I need
to go into Twitter and tell them that I want to be a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; of
their service. They&rsquo;ll ask me all kinds of details about who I am, and
then issue me a consumer ID, and a shared secret. The shared secret is a
random string that only they and I know. Now, when my app <em>asks</em> them
for a token, it identifies itself with the consumer ID, and they
validate it, which includes checking a signature built from the shared
secret, so they know it&rsquo;s a valid request. BTW, this consumer ID can be
used for billing later, as not all web services are free. Here comes
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SAAS</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it&rsquo;s not Twitter staff that need to approve this request,
it&rsquo;s the owner of the resource in question, the Twitter account holder.
This is good, as the account holder is the one who really cares here,
and the Twitter staff would otherwise be overloaded with handling
requests like these. Now, HTTP is a stateless protocol, so OAuth needs
to add some state in the approval process. So, initially when we request
a token, OAuth responds with a temporary one, so that the resource owner
can be redirected to Twitter itself to approve access to their account.
Assuming that you approve, a new token called a <em>verifier</em> will be
issued. This verifier can be provided in the response, or simply
displayed in the web page so that you can copy it into the app in an
&ldquo;out-of-band&rdquo; manner (ie. cut and paste).</p>
<p>This verifier is then used to request the final set of tokens from the
service. It proves to the OAuth subsystem attached to the service that:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The client was written by an approved vendor. <em>consumer id</em></li>
<li>The owner of the account wishes to grant access to this client.
<em>token and verifier</em></li>
<li>The request was not forged by some random ass-hat on the net.
<em>signature including shared secrets</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Once done, the app has a set of tokens that it can continually use to
make HTTP requests to Twitter&rsquo;s web service. The tokens issued can also
be limited in permissions, perhaps providing read access but not write
access, and perhaps to only specific areas of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>.
The tokens can also be revoked, if you wish to pull said access in the
future. This is a &ldquo;good thing&rdquo;. I use this to fetch tweets, to make
them, to manage follower lists, etc. All securely and authenticated over
HTTPS. And I do it from the command-line, with my own client written in
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, which I dubbed
<a href="https://github.com/msoulier/twit">Twit</a>. I pull my data from Google in
the same manner, for calendar events and contacts. Thus far it has
worked well.</p>
<p>Now, for what I want to do, I&rsquo;m implementing OAuth 1.0, even though the
2.0 &ldquo;standard&rdquo; is kinda coming. I phrase it this way because it&rsquo;s
been coming for a while now, and as communities often do, it&rsquo;s already
forked, dropped some security in the form of strong signatures, in the
name of developer convenience. So, I&rsquo;m sticking with 1.0. It&rsquo;s harder
to implement, but it&rsquo;s <em>done</em>, and it&rsquo;s more secure. I&rsquo;ve only just
gotten PLAINTEXT and HMAC-SHA1 signatures working, I&rsquo;ll post on that
soon. I&rsquo;m doing the server in <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> and
<a href="http://mojolicio.us/">Mojolicious</a> for legacy reasons, and implementing
it myself because I&rsquo;ve had issues with the <code>Net::OAuth</code> module for
Perl. Maybe I&rsquo;m using it wrong, but thus far I&rsquo;ve gotten no response
from the author. Plus, I learn much, much more this way.</p>
<p>This post is running a tad long, so I&rsquo;ll end it here, with more to come
on my trip into OAuth. Specifically implementing support for the
signatures. Funny thing is that the signing part is simple, but
constructing the base string is freakin&rsquo; hard. You&rsquo;ll get what I mean
if you read the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849">RFC</a>, or just stay
tuned.</p>
<p>See? Geeky. I warned you.</p>
