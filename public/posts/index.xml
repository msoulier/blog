      <description>&lt;p&gt;So previously I was using &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpelican.com/&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; which is still a solid option for me, but since Hugo is so popular I thought that I would take a look at it. That, and a workflow publish from &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/&#34;&gt;Org mode&lt;/a&gt;, which is now available with support in Emacs, NeoVim, and even some in VSCode.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Happy with what I see so far. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blogging with org-mode</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t used that &lt;strong&gt;other&lt;/strong&gt; editor in many, many years, with all of the hype around &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spacemacs.org/&#34;&gt;Spacemacs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/doomemacs&#34;&gt;Doom Emacs&lt;/a&gt;, etc., I thought that I would take another look. Granted, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vim.org&#34;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; has been forked as &lt;a href=&#34;https://neovim.io/&#34;&gt;NeoVim&lt;/a&gt;, with fun packages to compete like &lt;a href=&#34;https://nvchad.com/&#34;&gt;NVChad&lt;/a&gt;, but there has always been something about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; that intriged me, and horrified me at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The joke was always that Emacs was a wonderful operating system, it just needed a decent editor. Well, if that is a reference to Vi keybindings then &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil&#34;&gt;evil-mode&lt;/a&gt; works pretty damn well, at least as good as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim&#34;&gt;vim extension&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;. And, using Emacs keybindings isn&amp;rsquo;t that hard, although it is definitely a 2-handed exercise and might possibly contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Would you like to buy a vowel?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t get Marketing, I really don&amp;rsquo;t. Someone actually got paid to do this, and the company must have paid a lot of money to rebrand like this, but can you imagine the meeting when this was pitched to the suits in some office?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine it. WndRvr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mean, how did they even say it? Try it, right now, just to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re likely paid better than me, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2022 I took my lovely wife Maria to the exotic town of Kingston, Ontario for a weekend. The weather was beautiful, the AirBnB we stayed in was very nice, and overall we had a nice weekend, beyond my terrible overall lack of planning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You have to plan more than just the destination and accomodations, Michael.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, Kingston had an oddity that did stand out, when we walked down towards the water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just at the Ottawa hospital and one of the questions on their pre-screening questionnaire was,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you have Dementia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My response was, &amp;ldquo;How would I know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seems fair to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
