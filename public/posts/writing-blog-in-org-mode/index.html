      <p>So, as I haven&rsquo;t used that <strong>other</strong> editor in many, many years, with all of the hype around <a href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs">Doom Emacs</a>, etc., I thought that I would take another look. Granted, <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> has been forked as <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a>, with fun packages to compete like <a href="https://nvchad.com/">NVChad</a>, but there has always been something about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> that intriged me, and horrified me at the same time.</p>
<p>The joke was always that Emacs was a wonderful operating system, it just needed a decent editor. Well, if that is a reference to Vi keybindings then <a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil">evil-mode</a> works pretty damn well, at least as good as the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim">vim extension</a> for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>. And, using Emacs keybindings isn&rsquo;t that hard, although it is definitely a 2-handed exercise and might possibly contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
<p>It is heavyweight compared to Vim and NeoVim, and my experimental build that includes support for <a href="https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html">libgccjit native compilation</a> did nearly melt my poor Dell Latitude 5400 work laptop, but in fairness, running Intellisense in VSCode on a large C++ codebase nearly did the same thing.</p>
<p>So, while I&rsquo;ve pretty happy with my Vim, NeoVim and VS Code setups for writing code, my organizational tools were lacking. I did play with <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">Taskwarrior</a> for a while, and I really liked the 2.0 simple backend and taskd sync server in a docker container, but they&rsquo;ve dropped all of that in 3.0 in favour of an SQLite backend and no taskd. I was taking notes using <a href="https://vimwiki.github.io/">VimWiki</a> and it&rsquo;s great. Combine that with the <a href="https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg">Vim GnuPG plugin</a> and it was near perfect. Plus <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> of course for version control and sync. But I kept running across articles on <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>, and I was curious. So I decided to dust off my ancient Emacs config, update it, and take a solid look at org-mode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still text based, so the whole thing is in Git. Love it. There&rsquo;s a NeoVim plugin for it which took very little to get working, so if I can&rsquo;t stand Emacs anymore, I&rsquo;m not locked-in. There&rsquo;s even a VS Code plugin for it, but I think it has a way to go to keep up with the Emacs version. Being purely text, it&rsquo;s mostly future-proofed already. There are modes to handle GnuPG encryption of files, which is a great enhancement on my directory full of those that I finally started managing with <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>, which is awesome BTW. Editor support for PGP is amazing for an encrypted journal, or notes full of work passwords, etc.</p>
<p>The editor becomes the interface to the org-mode files, hiding what needs to be hidden, rendering plain text as if it were a more sophisticated productivity tool, and well, it is. Even if many don&rsquo;t recognize it as such. It&rsquo;s fairly impressive, and I&rsquo;m still not locked in. If I ever want to take my entire system back to say, Vimwiki with the files in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> format, well, the document swiss-army knife, <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>, can handle that. Not to mention there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://orgparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python module</a> that can read org, and a <a href="https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org">Go module</a>, so conversion would not be that difficult.</p>
<p>This blog is done with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, so the content is all Markdown. The cool thing is that you can build the blog <a href="https://andreyor.st/posts/2022-10-16-my-blogging-setup-with-emacs-and-org-mode/">with org-mode</a> where all of the posts are in a single file. So far I am really liking it too. I could repeat what others have already said so well, but what&rsquo;s the point? The details are all linked from here, so if you really want to know, follow them and read up.</p>
<p>Oh, one last thing. Emacs in Debian 12 (<a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/">Bookworm</a>), is not up to the latest, which at this time is 29.4. So I grabbed the code from the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git">Github mirror</a>, installed a few packages to build against, and built it to install in my home directory like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo apt install texinfo libgccjit-12-dev libgtk-4-dev libxaw7-dev libgnutls28-dev libgif-dev ripgrep
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git clone https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>cd emacs
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>autoreconf -vi
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>./configure --prefix<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$HOME/emacs
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>make
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>make install
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So if I want to get rid of it I just blow away that emacs directory. And I put it into my path of course.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Custom emacs build</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">[</span> -d $HOME/emacs <span style="color:#f92672">]</span>; <span style="color:#66d9ef">then</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    export PATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>$HOME<span style="color:#e6db74">/emacs/bin:</span>$PATH<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">fi</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;m still learning about Emacs packaging of plugins but I&rsquo;ll write about that later. So far I&rsquo;m quite happy with this setup, but I have a long way to go to make it comfortable. I&rsquo;ll add more on this topic as I learn more.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
