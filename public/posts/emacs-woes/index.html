      <p>So I recently got back into using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, primarily as a productivity tool. While it might be more at some point, my best programming weapons are still <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> and <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, sometimes <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a>, and usually in combination with <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">TMux</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator">vim-tmux-navigator</a> plugin. But I can always go into that later, or you can search for what is likely a better explanation elsewhere.</p>
<p>Emacs, originally short for &ldquo;Editor Macros&rdquo;, is quite well named. People come to Emacs looking for a direct comparison between VSCode and other solutions, which is foolish, as it turns out. The best explanation I heard was that Emacs is not an editor, it is a toolkit for building the perfect editor for you. But like a lot of things, there is some assembly required.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to assemble anything and want a more polished solution, thanks to the labour of others, then go look at <a href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">SpaceMacs</a> or <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">Doom Emacs</a>. I have a setup for the latter and it&rsquo;s quite good, but I wanted to learn more, so I&rsquo;ve set up my own Emacs from scratch, as it were. As it happens, it was also with the help of <a href="https://systemcrafters.net/">System Crafters</a> and <a href="https://daviwil.com/">David Wilson&rsquo;s</a> excellent youtube videos.</p>
<p>Now, not everything was completely rosy up to this point. I am currently running <a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a> 12 and it has Emacs 28.2. I did see a crash in that version so I looked upstream and found that they were up to Emacs 29.4 at that point, so I looked into how to build it myself, since for some odd reason, the GNU project is not releasing <a href="https://appimage.org/">AppImages</a> and prefers instead to use their own system, <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>. I didn&rsquo;t feel like using that so I went to the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git">Emacs Github mirror</a> and checked out the code. For those wanting to do that, here is my recipe:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo apt install autoconf automake libtool texinfo libgccjit-12-dev libgtk-4-dev libxaw7-dev libgnutls28-dev libgif-dev ripgrep libncurses-dev
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git clone https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>cd emacs
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>autoreconf -vi
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>./configure --prefix<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$HOME/emacs
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That said, it&rsquo;s not like guix is hard to use on Debian, so you might actually save disk space and time if you use it. I tried it in a container and it was basically `guix install emacs`, so I think they&rsquo;re doing good work on guix. Sad that it is a competing effort instead of aligning on one good solution though. The community is fragmented enough already.</p>
<p>So, at this time I am primary using Emacs for one of its killer apps, which is <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>. I am coming from <a href="https://vimwiki.github.io/">VimWiki</a>, which is awesome, but VimWiki does not include a productivity framework (mind you, install <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">TaskWarrior</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tools-life/taskwiki">TaskWiki</a> and it gains a damn good one), and I love the fact that org-mode is all text based and also works with <a href="https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode">NeoVim</a> if you set it up. Hell, even VSCode has some support for it, and if you want to move away from it, <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">Pandoc</a> can convert .org to .md to get you back to something that is VimWiki compatible. So I don&rsquo;t mind getting really into using it because I can get back out easily enough if I choose. Previously I was using TaskWarrior, but I dropped it for various reasons that I can go into another time. I am not against going back to it though, if this doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>And that brings me to the problems that I&rsquo;ve seen. Granted, most of my experiences have been good ones, but no one wants to hear about those. Just like slowing down to look at a car crash, you want to know what&rsquo;s gone wrong. So far, I&rsquo;ve seen two major issues, not counting my own wasted time constantly tweaking my configuration.</p>
<ol>
<li>Native Compilation.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was an experimental feature in 29.4, so I tried in my custom build, turning it on. My understanding is that while Emacs already byte-compiles elisp to bytecode, native compilation goes much further, greatly optimizing the elisp codebase. So of course I tried it.</p>
<p>When I first started that Emacs build I heard my CPU fan go wild. But I let it go, monitoring the compile output buffer and it told me what it was doing. I went to dinner and came back. It was still going. And the compile buffer&hellip;wasn&rsquo;t. For some reason it just sat there chewing a ton of CPU doing God-knows-what. I finally told it to quit, and it did. When I started it again it started up again, so I killed that build and turned the feature off.</p>
<p>Now in 30.1 the feature is unconditionally on. It behaved identically except when I exited and restarted, the problem went away. This does not fill me with confidence.</p>
<ol>
<li>Org Mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the killer app that pulled me back into Emacs in the first place. As it is processing a lot of text files, it is understood that performance will be an issue. This is why org-roam optimizes itself with a back-end SQLite database. I like the pure text nature of org-mode, and I am willing to put up with a little performance problem while using it from time to time. But not like the problem I recently ran into.</p>
<p>I am using a journal.org capture file to capture random journal entries, and the standard setup for this indents for year, month, day and then the journal entry itself. I am using some special characters to represent the bullets, and some faces (fonts) that increase in size the more important the bullets are. This normally is not a problem. But for a theme I was using <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes">modus-vivendi</a>, which is great, but I think it might have specified some faces that my system did not have, because loading my journal hung while Emacs chewed 100% cpu, and when I finally killed it and got a corefile it was in some kind of face processing code. As soon as I changed themes the problem went away, but again, this does not inspire confidence.</p>
<p>So, mostly my experiences have been excellent. But, it&rsquo;s software. Software has bugs. The question as to whether you use a piece of software is whether the bugs are something that you can tolerate.</p>
