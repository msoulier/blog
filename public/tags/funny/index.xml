The weather was beautiful, the AirBnB we stayed in was very nice, and overall we had a nice weekend, beyond my terrible overall lack of planning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You have to plan more than just the destination and accomodations, Michael.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, Kingston had an oddity that did stand out, when we walked down towards the water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
