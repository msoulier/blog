      <description>&lt;p&gt;So while it is important to know how to use Gnome on a linux desktop, the fact is that it is not my favorite desktop environment for linux. It is far too &amp;ldquo;dumbed-down&amp;rdquo; and made mostly for the masses, and I tend to be more of a &amp;ldquo;power-user&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I became a big fan of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://i3wm.org/&#34;&gt;I3&lt;/a&gt; tiling window manager. It just fit the way that I work, and I found myself highly productive with it. But I3 was made to integrate with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.x.org/&#34;&gt;Xorg&lt;/a&gt;, and that was beginning to show its age, so the community has been working on a more modern replacement for X, being &lt;a href=&#34;https://wayland.freedesktop.org/&#34;&gt;Wayland&lt;/a&gt;. But I3 doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with Wayland! The horror!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
